# MCP Server — Claude Code & AI Agents

The CreatAds MCP server exposes the full API as tools, letting Claude Code and any MCP-compatible agent generate ad creatives directly from a conversation — no UI needed.

The server runs at `https://api.creatads.co/mcp` (HTTP, stateless JSON-RPC 2.0). No local install required.

## Setup

### 1. Get your API key

Open **Settings → API Keys** in the app and copy your `cads_...` key.

### 2. Add the MCP server to Claude Code

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http creatads https://api.creatads.co/mcp \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_CADS_KEY"
```

That's it. Claude Code will discover the tools automatically.

### 3. Verify

In a Claude Code session:

```
Use the creatads list_clients tool
```

## Example agent workflow

Paste this prompt in Claude Code to generate a full campaign autonomously:

```
I need to launch a campaign for my client Bobotcho (bidet brand).
Use the creatads tools to:
1. List the existing profiles and pick the 2 most relevant for urban eco-conscious buyers
2. Create a campaign called "Été 2026" with CTA "Découvrir", offer "Livraison offerte",
   formats 1:1 and 9:16, volume 4
3. Generate the creatives, then poll list_creatives until images are ready and return the URLs
```

Claude will autonomously call `list_profiles` → `create_campaign` → `generate_creatives` → `list_creatives` and return the URLs.

---

## Typical call sequence

```
1. list_clients                          → get client_id
2. list_profiles(client_id)              → get profile IDs
   └─ or generate_profiles(...)         → if no profiles yet
3. create_campaign(client_id, ...)       → get campaign_id
4. generate_creatives(campaign_id)       → starts background generation
5. list_creatives(campaign_id)           → poll until images appear
```
